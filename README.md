# AFF4 -The Advanced Forensics File Format

The Advanced Forensics File format 4 was originally designed and published in
"Extending the advanced forensic format to accommodate multiple data sources,

The format is an open source format used for the storage of digital evidence and

purpose AFF4 library.
